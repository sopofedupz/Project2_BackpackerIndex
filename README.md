Backpacker Index for 2020 - Cheapest vs Most Expensive Cities

### Team Members:
Henock Yacob
Yee Mun Chan
Anastasia Bolboceanu
Junior Jean-Simon 

### Data Source:
Price of Travel: https://www.priceoftravel.com/world-cities-by-price-backpacker-index/
Lat/Lon Coordinates: https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities

### Visualizations:
Interactive Map (with Markers)
Range Visualization (e.g., span chart, histogram, etc…)
Gauges (i.e., temperature, precipitation, etc…)
Comparison Page

### Method:
We will use a Web Scraping approach to gather our data and load it to SQLite then visualize the data using a simple Dashboard, with a map to control various other charts.
For specific portions of our datasets from SQLite we aim to show users popular travel destinations for different components. For example, Food Cost, Hotel Cost, Transportation, etc...
